# Champagne Bottle Simulation

My 1st trial using Cursor Composer Agent mode. Everything was done by the agent (including terminal commands, directory and file generation etc)

An interactive physics-based simulation of a champagne bottle, demonstrating pressure, cork dynamics, and fluid behavior.

## Features

- Realistic cork physics with friction and pressure-based movement
- Pressure visualization with real-time graph
- Temperature effects on pressure decay
- Interactive controls for:
  - Initial pressure
  - Temperature
  - Cork release pressure
  - Bottle shaking
- Visual effects for cork popping and champagne spray

## Controls

- Initial Pressure: Set the starting pressure in the bottle (1-10 bar)
- Temperature: Adjust the temperature affecting pressure decay (5-25Â°C)
- Cork Release Pressure: Set the pressure at which cork starts moving (5-9 bar)
- Shake Bottle: Increase internal pressure
- Open Bottle: Start cork movement

## Try It Out

Open `index.html` in a web browser to run the simulation.
